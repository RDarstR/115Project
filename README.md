# 115Project
My repo for the Final Project in Data115

My goal is to analyze the All Pokemon Dataset.
This data comes from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maca11/all-pokemon-dataset](Kaggle). The author of this dataset is Mario Hernandez. They scraped the data from [https://serebii.net/](Serebii), [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page](Bulbapedia), and [https://pokemondb.net/](The Pokemon Database). All of these are popular and useful websites within the Pokemon Community.
