# 115Project
My repo for the Final Project in Data115

My goal is to analyze the All Pokemon Dataset.
This data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maca11/all-pokemon-dataset). The author of this dataset is Mario Hernandez. They scraped the data from [Serebii](https://serebii.net/), [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page), and [The Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net/). All of these are popular and useful websites within the Pokemon Community.
